<h1>Lumbr</h1>

<h2>Getting started with Lumbr</h2>

<p>Simplicity, flexibility and rapidness is what Lumbr is all about. To get going with lumbr you need a SASS preprocessor with autoprefixor on. E.g. Codekit for Mac OS X.</p>

<p>With that cover fire up the project and set the style.scss to compile to the root /style.min.css</p>

<p>There you go, set up your projects base settings in: _config.scss</p>

<p>After that apply your own layout to: _layout.scss</p>
