            <p>This is a standard paragraph created using the WordPress TinyMCE text editor. It has a <strong>strong tag</strong>, an <em>em tag</em> and a <del>strikethrough</del> which is actually just the del element. There are a few more inline elements which are not in the WordPress admin but we should check for incase your users get busy with the copy and paste. These include <cite>citations</cite>, <abbr title="abbreviation">abbr</abbr>, bits of <code>code</code> and <var>variables</var>, <q>inline quotations</q>, <ins datetime="2011-12-08T20:19:53+00:00">inserted text</ins>, text that is <s>no longer accurate</s> or something <mark>so important</mark> you might want to mark it. We can also style subscript and superscript characters like C0<sub>2</sub>, here is our 2<sup>nd</sup> example. If they are feeling non-semantic they might even use <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, <big>big</big> or <small>small</small> elements too.&nbsp;Incidentally, these HTML4.01 tags have been given new life and semantic meaning in HTML5, you may be interested in reading this <a title="HTML5 Semantics" href="http://csswizardry.com/2011/01/html5-and-text-level-semantics">article by Harry Roberts</a> which gives a nice excuse to test a link.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also worth noting in the "kitchen sink" view you can also add <span style="text-decoration: underline;">underline</span>&nbsp;styling and set <span>text color</span> with pesky inline CSS.</p>

            <p style="text-align: left;">Additionally, WordPress also sets text alignment with inline styles, like this left aligned paragraph.&nbsp;Aenean eu leo quam. Pellentesque ornare sem lacinia quam venenatis vestibulum. Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum.</p>

            <p style="text-align: right;">This is a right aligned paragraph.&nbsp;Aenean eu leo quam. Pellentesque ornare sem lacinia quam venenatis vestibulum. Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">This is a justified paragraph.&nbsp;Aenean eu leo quam. Pellentesque ornare sem lacinia quam venenatis vestibulum. Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum.</p>

            <p class="indent">Finally, you also have the option of an indented paragraph.&nbsp;Aenean eu leo quam. Pellentesque ornare sem lacinia quam venenatis vestibulum. Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum.</p> <p>And last, and by no means least, users can also apply the <code>Address</code> tag to text like this:</p> 

            <address>123 Example Street,
            Testville,
            West Madeupsburg,
            CSSland,
            1234</address>

            <p>...so there you have it, all our text elements</p>

            Currently WordPress blockquotes are just wrapped in blockquote tags and have no clear way for the user to define a source. Maybe one day they'll be more semantic (and easier to style) like the version below.
