            Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.</p>


            <p>Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.

            <p>This is a standard paragraph created using the WordPress TinyMCE text editor. It has a <strong>strong tag</strong>, an <em>em tag</em> and a <del>strikethrough</del> which is actually just the del element. There are a few more inline elements which are not in the WordPress admin but we should check for incase your users get busy with the copy and paste. These include <cite>citations</cite>, <abbr title="abbreviation">abbr</abbr>, bits of <code>code</code> and <var>variables</var>, <q>inline quotations</q>, <ins datetime="2011-12-08T20:19:53+00:00">inserted text</ins>, text that is <s>no longer accurate</s> or something <mark>so important</mark> you might want to mark it. We can also style subscript and superscript characters like C0<sub>2</sub>, here is our 2<sup>nd</sup> example. If they are feeling non-semantic they might even use <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, <big>big</big> or <small>small</small> elements too.&nbsp;Incidentally, these HTML4.01 tags have been given new life and semantic meaning in HTML5, you may be interested in reading this <a title="HTML5 Semantics" href="http://csswizardry.com/2011/01/html5-and-text-level-semantics">article by Harry Roberts</a> which gives a nice excuse to test a link.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also worth noting in the "kitchen sink" view you can also add <span style="text-decoration: underline;">underline</span>&nbsp;styling and set <span>text color</span> with pesky inline CSS.</p>

            <p style="text-align: left;">Additionally, WordPress also sets text alignment with inline styles, like this left aligned paragraph.&nbsp;Aenean eu leo quam. Pellentesque ornare sem lacinia quam venenatis vestibulum. Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum.</p>

            <p style="text-align: right;">This is a right aligned paragraph.&nbsp;Aenean eu leo quam. Pellentesque ornare sem lacinia quam venenatis vestibulum. Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">This is a justified paragraph.&nbsp;Aenean eu leo quam. Pellentesque ornare sem lacinia quam venenatis vestibulum. Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum.</p>

            <p class="indent">Finally, you also have the option of an indented paragraph.&nbsp;Aenean eu leo quam. Pellentesque ornare sem lacinia quam venenatis vestibulum. Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum.</p> <p>And last, and by no means least, users can also apply the <code>Address</code> tag to text like this:</p> 

            <address>123 Example Street,
            Testville,
            West Madeupsburg,
            CSSland,
            1234</address>

            <p>...so there you have it, all our text elements</p>

            <blockquote>
            
            Currently WordPress blockquotes are just wrapped in blockquote tags and have no clear way for the user to define a source. Maybe one day they'll be more semantic (and easier to style) like the version below.

Finally, users can insert a WordPress [gallery], which is kinda ugly and comes with some CSS stuck into the page to style it (which doesn't actually validate, nor does the markup for the gallery). The amount of columns in the gallery is also changable by the user, but the default is three so we'll work with that for our example with an added fouth image to test verticle spacing.

Finally, users can insert a WordPress [gallery], which is kinda ugly and comes with some CSS stuck into the page to style it (which doesn't actually validate, nor does the markup for the gallery). The amount of columns in the gallery is also changable by the user, but the default is three so we'll work with that for our example with an added fouth image to test verticle spacing. Additionally, to add further confusion, images can be wrapped inside paragraph content, lets test some examples here. Your Alt Title Vivamus sagittis lacus vel augue laoreet rutrum faucibus dolor auctor. Maecenas sed diam eget risus varius blandit sit amet non magna.
