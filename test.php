            Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn't listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way.</p>

            <p>This is a standard paragraph created using the WordPress TinyMCE text editor. It has a <strong>strong tag</strong>, an <em>em tag</em> and a <del>strikethrough</del> which is actually just the del element. There are a few more inline elements which are not in the WordPress admin but we should check for incase your users get busy with the copy and paste. These include <cite>citations</cite>, <abbr title="abbreviation">abbr</abbr>, bits of <code>code</code> and <var>variables</var>, <q>inline quotations</q>, <ins datetime="2011-12-08T20:19:53+00:00">inserted text</ins>, text that is <s>no longer accurate</s> or something <mark>so important</mark> you might want to mark it. We can also style subscript and superscript characters like C0<sub>2</sub>, here is our 2<sup>nd</sup> example. If they are feeling non-semantic they might even use <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, <big>big</big> or <small>small</small> elements too.&nbsp;Incidentally, these HTML4.01 tags have been given new life and semantic meaning in HTML5, you may be interested in reading this <a title="HTML5 Semantics" href="http://csswizardry.com/2011/01/html5-and-text-level-semantics">article by Harry Roberts</a> which gives a nice excuse to test a link.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also worth noting in the "kitchen sink" view you can also add <span style="text-decoration: underline;">underline</span>&nbsp;styling and set <span>text color</span> with pesky inline CSS.</p>
            <p class="indent">Finally, you also have the option of an indented paragraph.&nbsp;Aenean eu leo quam. Pellentesque ornare sem lacinia quam venenatis vestibulum. Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum.</p> <p>And last, and by no means least, users can also apply the <code>Address</code> tag to text like this:</p> 

            <address>123 Example Street,
            Testville,
            West Madeupsburg,
            CSSland,
            1234</address>

            <p>...so there you have it, all our text elements</p>

            <blockquote>
            
            Currently WordPress blockquotes are just wrapped in blockquote tags and have no clear way for the user to define a source. Maybe one day they'll be more semantic (and easier to style) like the version below.

            <p>HTML5 comes to our rescue with the footer element, allowing us to add semantically separate information about the quote.</p>
