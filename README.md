Lumbr
=============

Getting started with Lumbr
-------

Simplicity, flexibility and rapidness is what Lumbr is all about. To get going with lumbr you need a SASS preprocessor with autoprefixor on. E.g. Codekit for Mac OS X.

With that cover fire up the project and set the style.scss to compile to the root /style.min.css

There you go, set up your projects base settings in: _config.scss

After that apply your own layout to: _layout.scss
